## 📌 Overview

In this topic, I moved beyond theoretical networking concepts and focused on the physical components that make communication possible.

While Topic 1 explored how data moves logically through layers, this topic focuses on what actually connects everything together — cables, switches, patch panels, routers, and access points.

Understanding both physical and logical layouts is essential for designing reliable networks.

- Describe LAN connection mediums (copper and fiber)
- Compare Ethernet standards used in modern businesses
- Explain the core technologies behind data communication
- Configure and patch physical network devices
- Transition from a SOHO setup to small business infrastructure
