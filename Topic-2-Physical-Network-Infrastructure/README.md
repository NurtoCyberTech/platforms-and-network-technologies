## 📌 Overview

In this topic, I moved beyond theoretical networking concepts and focused on the physical components that make communication possible.

While Topic 1 explored how data moves logically through layers, this topic focuses on what actually connects everything together — cables, switches, patch panels, routers, and access points.

Understanding both physical and logical layouts is essential for designing reliable networks.

## 🖼 Physical Network Layout Example

![Physical Network Diagram](images/physical-network-diagram.png)

This diagram represents a structured small business network. 

Unlike a simple SOHO router setup, this design separates infrastructure into dedicated components:

- Patch panels for cable management  
- Switches for internal traffic  
- Access points for wireless connectivity  
- Routers for WAN routing  
- Modems for ISP connectivity  

This structured approach improves scalability, reliability, and organization.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this topic, I learned to:

- Describe LAN connection mediums (copper and fiber)
- Compare Ethernet standards used in modern businesses
- Explain the core technologies behind data communication
- Configure and patch physical network devices
- Transition from a SOHO setup to small business infrastructure

## 🌐 Ethernet Standards in Modern Networks

Modern business networks rely on standardized Ethernet speeds and cable categories.

### 📌 Common Cable Categories

| Category | Maximum Speed | Maximum Distance | Typical Use |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Cat5e | 1 Gbps | 100 meters | Basic office networks |
| Cat6 | 1–10 Gbps | 100m (1 Gbps) / 55m (10 Gbps) | Modern business networks |
| Cat6a | 10 Gbps | 100 meters | High-performance environments |

### 📡 Ethernet Standards

| Standard | Speed | Medium |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 100BASE-TX | 100 Mbps | Twisted Pair |
| 1000BASE-T | 1 Gbps | Twisted Pair |
| 10GBASE-T | 10 Gbps | Twisted Pair |
| 1000BASE-SX | 1 Gbps | Fiber |
| 10GBASE-SR | 10 Gbps | Fiber |

These standards define how data is transmitted over different physical mediums.

## 💭 Reflection

Topic 2 shifted my focus from logical networking theory to the physical components that make communication possible.

Understanding structured cabling, patch panels, switches, and Ethernet standards helped me see how infrastructure design directly affects performance and scalability.

This topic reinforced that reliable networks are built from the ground up — starting with proper physical implementation.
