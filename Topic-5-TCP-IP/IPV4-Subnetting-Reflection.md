# 📊 IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting

---

## 📌 Why Subnetting Matters

Subnetting allows networks to be divided into smaller, manageable sections.

This improves:
- Performance
- Organization
- Security

Instead of one massive network, subnetting creates logical groupings.

---

## 🔢 Key Concepts Practiced

- Decimal to binary conversion
- Binary to decimal conversion
- Identifying network vs host bits
- Classful vs classless addressing
- CIDR prefix notation
- Public vs private IP ranges
- Determining if two IPs are on the same network

---

## 🌍 Public vs Private Addresses

Private IP ranges include:

- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

These are used inside organizations.

Public IP addresses are globally routable on the internet.

Understanding this distinction is critical when designing secure internal networks.

## 💡 Personal Reflection

At first, subnetting felt intimidating.

But once I understood:

- How subnet masks define boundaries
- How prefix notation works
- How routers determine “same network vs different network”

It became a logical process rather than memorization.

Subnetting is one of the most powerful skills in networking because it directly affects performance, scalability, and security.
