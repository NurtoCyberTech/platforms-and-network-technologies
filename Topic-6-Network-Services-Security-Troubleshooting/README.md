# 🔐 Topic 6: Network Services, Security, & Troubleshooting

- 📖 [Overview](Topic-6-Network-Services-Security-Troubleshooting/README.md)

---

## 📌 Overview

In this topic, I moved beyond basic network structure and began focusing on the services and security mechanisms that keep networks operational and protected.

While earlier topics explored how networks are built, this topic focused on:

- How devices receive IP addresses
- How domain names resolve to IP addresses
- How administrators troubleshoot connectivity
- How organizations protect infrastructure from cyber threats

This topic connects technical configuration with security awareness and real-world troubleshooting strategy.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Identify core network infrastructure devices and their roles
- Understand common network services such as DHCP, DNS, and NTP
- Explore cybersecurity partnerships and defense frameworks
- Apply the OSI model to troubleshoot connectivity issues
- Use command-line tools to verify network health

## 🔄 Structured Troubleshooting Process

When diagnosing network issues, I use a layered approach based on the OSI model.

User reports problem
↓
Check Physical Layer
(Cables, link lights, Wi-Fi signal)
↓
Check Data Link Layer
(VLAN, MAC table, switch ports)
↓
Check Network Layer
(IP address, subnet mask, gateway)
↓
Check Transport Layer
(Ports open? TCP/UDP reachable?)
↓
Check Application Layer
(DNS resolution? Service running?)
↓
Issue Identified & Resolved

This structured method prevents guesswork and allows systematic isolation of issues.

## 🔎 Why This Topic Matters

Network services are the invisible systems that allow everything to function smoothly. Without DHCP, devices cannot communicate properly. Without DNS, users cannot reach websites by name. Without security planning, organizations are vulnerable.

This topic helped me understand that networking is not just about cables and routers — it is about reliability, structure, and protection.
