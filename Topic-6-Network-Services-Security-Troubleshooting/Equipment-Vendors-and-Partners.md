## 📌 Project Overview

As organizations grow, their network infrastructure must evolve with them. This assignment required me to step into the role of IT consultant and advise executive leadership on technology and cybersecurity decisions.

The focus was not simply choosing products, but evaluating long-term scalability, vendor reliability, and ethical alignment.
