# 🖥 Packet Tracer Lab: SOHO Network Implementation

## 🏢 Scenario Overview

To apply the networking concepts learned in the OSI model, I completed a hands-on lab using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The scenario involved designing a small office network for a startup business called **Sonoran Timber Studio**, a custom woodworking company based in Phoenix, Arizona.

The company operates with fewer than ten employees and relies on a basic SOHO (Small Office / Home Office) network setup.

My role was to modify and test the existing network topology to support new devices and ensure proper connectivity.

## 🔧 Network Modifications Performed

### ➤ Added New Devices

Using the Physical layout view:

- Added a new PC to the conference room
- Added a new laptop to the foyer area

This simulated business growth and required updating the network infrastructure.

---

### ➤ Removed an Existing Device

In the Logical layout view:

- Removed the previous Sales Laptop from the topology

This reinforced how network diagrams must reflect real-world changes in personnel and equipment.

---

### ➤ Configured Wireless Capability

For the new laptop:

- Powered the device off
- Removed the wired Ethernet interface
- Installed a wireless network adapter
- Powered the device back on
- Renamed the device to reflect a user workstation

This demonstrated how hardware configuration directly affects network connectivity.

### ➤ Connected the PC to the Router

The PC was connected using a copper straight-through cable to the Wi-Fi router.

This allowed the PC to communicate through the router and access network resources.

---

## 🌐 IP Configuration and Testing

To verify proper configuration:

- Enabled DHCP on the PC
- Confirmed automatic IP address assignment
- Opened the web browser
- Tested connectivity by accessing an external website

Successful page loading confirmed that:

- The router was functioning as a DHCP server
- Devices were properly connected
- Internet connectivity was operational

## 💡 Key Concepts Reinforced

This lab helped strengthen my understanding of:

- The difference between Physical and Logical network layouts
- DHCP and automatic IP addressing
- Wired vs wireless configurations
- Basic SOHO network structure
- Network verification and troubleshooting

This exercise connected the OSI model theory to real-world network implementation.
